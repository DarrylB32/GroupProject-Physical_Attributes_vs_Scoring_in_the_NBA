This project explores the relationship between physical attributes (height & wingspan) of players in the NBA and their scoring percentages. The [NBA_DATA_PRESENTATION](NBA_DATA_PRESENTATION.ipynb) script shows in detail the Extraction and Transformation. The data was used as part of the [NBA_Data_Analysis_Presentation](NBA_Data_Analysis_Presentation.pptx).
